# Gordon Ramsay Scrambled Eggs

## Ingredients
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 6 | Cold eggs |
| 1 tbsp | Butter |
| To taste | Salt and pepper |
| 1 tsp | Crème fraîche |
| To taste | Chives |
| As needed | Sourdough bread |
| As needed | Olive oil |

## Prep
- [ ] Finely chop the chives.
- [ ] Slice sourdough bread to fit in the toaster.
- [ ] Make sure the crème fraîche is open and ready.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Adding the crème fraîche is time sensitive and stops the eggs from continuing to cook after taking them off the heat.

## Cooking instructions
- [ ] Toast the slices of sourdough bread.
- [ ] Crack 6 cold eggs into a deep saucepan.
- [ ] Add the butter. For smaller batches, use a 2-to-1 eggs-to-butter ratio.
- [ ] Put the pan on high heat.
- [ ] Stir continuously with a rubber spatula — don't whisk — making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan.
- [ ] After 30 seconds, take the pan off the heat. Keep stirring. After about 10 seconds, put back on the heat. Repeat for 3 minutes.
- [ ] In the last minute, season the eggs lightly and fold in the chopped chives. 
- [ ] For extra creamy texture, stir in 1 tsp of crème fraîche.
- [ ] Lightly drizzle toasted bread with olive oil.
- [ ] Put the scrambled eggs on the pieces of toast and serve!
