| 4 | Large shallots, peeled and sliced |
| 12 | Black peppercorns |

| 1 Splash | Red wine vinegar |

Ingredients
700g-800g beef fillet, cut from the centre of the fillet so that it's all the same size
large knob of butter
1 tbsp sunflower oil
500g spinach
12 thin slices smoked pancetta or rindless streaky bacon
plain flour, for dusting
500g pack all-butter puff pastry
2 egg yolks
For the gravy
knob of butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
thyme sprig
1 bay leaf
1 tbsp plain flour
glass of red wine
1 beef stock cube








## Prep
- [ ] Finely chop mushrooms
- [ ] Pull the leaves off the thyme sprig
- [ ] Egg wash: Beat 2 egg yolks with 1 tbsp of water and a pinch of salt

## Method
### Preparing the Beef
- [ ] Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling film to set its shape, then chill overnight.
- [ ] Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until browned all over and rare in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave to cool.
- [ ] Fry the chopped mushrooms in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves, and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle).
- [ ] Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.
- [ ] Cut the puff pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. Chill in the refrigerator.
- [ ] Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.
- [ ] Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.
- [ ] Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes. Continue to the red wine sauce while the beef chills.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Preheat the oven while preparing the red wine sauce.

### Preparing the Red Wine Sauce
- [ ] Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on all sides. 
- [ ] Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay leaf, and thyme. Continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.
- [ ] Pour in the vinegar and let it bubble for a few minutes until almost dry. 
- [ ] Add the wine and boil until almost completely reduced. 
- [ ] Add the beef stock and bring to a boil again.
- [ ] Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, removing any scum from the surface of the sauce, until you have the desired consistency. 
- [ ] Strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with muslin. 
- [ ] Check for seasoning and set aside.

### Baking the Wellington
- [ ] Score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash again.
- [ ] Bake at 200&deg;C (~400&deg;F) for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. 
- [ ] Rest for 10 minutes before carving.
- [ ] Reheat the sauce. 
- [ ] Serve the beef wellingtons sliced, with the sauce as an accompaniment.





Method
STEP 1
Pat the beef fillet with kitchen paper to remove any blood, then season. Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan until very hot, then sear and turn the fillet with tongs for 8-10 mins until it’s well browned on all sides – hold it up to sear both ends, too. Set the beef aside on a tray to catch any juices. Take the pan off the heat, but don’t clean it.

STEP 2
Tip the spinach into a colander and pour over a kettle of boiling water to wilt it, then pour over cold water to cool it down. Squeeze the spinach as hard as you can to extract as much liquid as possible, then set aside. Lay a large sheet of cling film on your work surface. Overlap the pancetta or bacon on it in a row, then cover with another sheet of cling film. Use a rolling pin to roll it out to a thin layer. Remove the top sheet of cling film and scatter the spinach over the pancetta. Replace the cling film and roll again. Carefully peel away the top layer of cling film again, and sit the beef on top. Using the edge of the cling film, lift and roll the pancetta and spinach to encase the beef and roll everything into a tight sausage. For best results, place in the freezer for 30 mins to firm up – do not leave for longer or cooking times will be affected.

STEP 3
On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry to a rectangle a little larger than your Good Food magazine. Trim the edges to neaten, then lightly brush the pastry with egg yolk. Carefully unwrap the beef parcel and lay in the middle of the pastry. Fold the shorter edges over the beef, then roll the whole thing around the fillet to encase. For a really neat finish, get another clean sheet of cling film and roll the wellington into a tight sausage again. Chill for at least 30 mins, or up to one day.

STEP 4
Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and put a lightly oiled baking tray in it. Unwrap the wellington, brush with egg yolk, then use the back of a knife to score a neat criss-cross or checkerboard pattern all over it. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and transfer, sealed-side down, to the hot baking tray. Roast for 10 mins, then reduce the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and continue to cook for 25 mins for rare meat, 30 mins for medium rare, 35 mins for medium, and about 45 mins for well done, making sure the pastry doesn’t burn (cover it with foil if it starts to darken). Remove from the oven and immediately brush with more egg yolk. Leave to rest for 10 mins.

STEP 5
To make the gravy, heat the butter in the beef pan. Fry the shallot, thyme and bay leaf, scraping the crispy bits off the pan with a wooden spoon. Scatter over the flour and brown, then add the red wine and boil to a purple paste. Add the beef stock cube and any juice from the resting beef, and simmer for 5 mins. Pass through a sieve into a pan and season to taste. Use a sharp knife to carve the wellington into six thick slices and serve with the gravy on the side.
