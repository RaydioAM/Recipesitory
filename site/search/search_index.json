Once onions are caramelized, add wine and sherry to the pot and allow mixture to come to boil. Stir in flour and let thicken for a minute or two. Slowly add warm broth, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper to the onion mixture and boil uncovered for 10 minutes. Add more salt and pepper to taste.

Its defining ingredients are red meat and onions in gravy or sauce, with a topping of mashed potato. Ingredients Filling Quantity Ingredient 1.5 lbs Ground lamb or beef 1 Large carrot (grated) 1 Large onion (grated) 2 tbsp Olive oil 4 Garlic cloves (minced) 1 bag Frozen peas As needed Fresh Rosemary As needed Fresh Thyme As needed Salt and pepper Several splashes Worcestershire sauce Small can Tomato paste or puree Several glugs Red wine 1/4 cup Chicken stock Mashed Potatoes Quantity Ingredient 1.5 lbs Golden potatoes 1/4 cup Heavy cream 3 1/2 tbsp. Butter As needed Salt and pepper 2 Egg yolks 1/4-1/2 cup Parmesan cheese Prep Dice the garlic Separate herbs from the stems Separate egg Yolks Peel and Slice potatoes into even pieces Open wine if it's not already Open can of Tomato Paste Cook Cooking the Potatoes This part is easy as pie (no pun intended), just boil some water, throw some salt and your potatoes in, and set a timer for 15 minutes - start on your filling. Upon the timer going off, take your potatoes out and strain the water off. Put potatoes back into the pan, or into a medium mixing bowl. Mash the potatoes with their ingredients from above and keep warm (your filling should be about done by this point) Cooking the Filling Pour Olive Oil into a hot, rather large pan, then add meat. Stir meat as if your life depends on it for a few minutes so it's nice and brown, and broken into very small pieces. Add your Rosemary, Thyme, and Garlic, then stir some more. Quickly add your Carrot, Onion, and frozen peas, stir a little longer. The idea at this point is to get everything to a minced consistency. Add Worcestershire Sauce, stir, add Tomato Puree, stir, add Red Wine and sweat down for a minute or two. Add chicken stock and cook for 3 more minutes. Final Preparation Scoop your meat mixture into a deep casserole or other oven safe dish and then spoon the mash over the top. Spread the mash over the top of the mix with the bottom of the spoon and then sprinkle a generous portion of Parmesan cheese over the top. Poke the top with a fork several times to give it a peaked look and stick it in the oven at 400 degrees for 18-20 minutes to brown the potatoes and set the pie.
